# Unified Agent API 
Overview

The **Unified Agent API** is a powerful and flexible solution to create and manage AI agents across two popular platforms: **Vapi** and **Retell**. By providing a unified interface, this API simplifies the creation process of agents with customizable parameters like voice, models, and webhooks.

Whether you are building a customer service assistant, a virtual agent for your business, or any other AI-powered solution, the Unified Agent API offers a seamless way to manage everything from a single endpoint.

##  Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rohithprox/assignment1-api
2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install the necessary Python packages:


cd unified-agent-api
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up Your Environment Variables
You will need to set up two environment variables for your API keys:

VAPI_API_KEY: Your Vapi API key 

RETELL_API_KEY: Your Retell API key 

For local development, you can set them in .env or directly in your terminal session:

bash
Copy
Edit
export VAPI_API_KEY="your_vapi_key"
export RETELL_API_KEY="your_retell_key"
4. Run the API
Start the FastAPI app with:
uvicorn main:app --reload
Now you can access the API at http://localhost:8000.
